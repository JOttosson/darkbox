DarkBox
=======

DarkBox is a blatant clone of the [LightBox](http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/) software for displaying images. It uses CSS effects wherever possible, specifically CSS3 Transitions for animation, which means it looks super hot in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera. In older browsers it just looks hot.
